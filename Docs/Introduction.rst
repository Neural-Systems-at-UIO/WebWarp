**Introduction**
------------------- 
WebWarp is an online tool for nonlinear refinement of spatial registration of histological section images from rodent brains to reference 3D atlases. Webwarp is compatible with registration performed with the WebAlign tool.
Different experimental datasets registered to the same reference atlas allows you to spatially integrate, analyse and navigate these datasets within a standardised coordinate system.
The output of Webwarp can be used for analysis in the online QUINT workflow.
